## Why not Firefox ?

- Initially, the extension did not work in Firefox. Booting Ember.js as a browser extension is not something that works well within Firefox's addon runtime. The first Firefox version relied on hacks and as expected, it broke after doing some updates. Having to hack into libs to make sure they can work in Firefox is not something that I want to do in my spare time;
- Firefox addon store review process for new updates is way more strict and time-consuming to deal with compared to Chrome's;
- The project is developed as a Chrome-first project, which means problems can be quickly detected during development instead of having to test everything twice;
- Now that both Chrome and Firefox versions have been live for a while, I can see that Firefox represented less than 10% of BetterTrading users;

In the meantime, you can continue to use version [1.3.2 on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-pathofexile-trading/) or you can use Chrome for your PoE business ✌️
