# BetterTrading is back!

BetterTrading has found a new maintainer! For bug reports or feature requests, [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/exile-center/better-trading/issues/new).

## New features ✨

- Divine Orbs have replaced Exalted Orbs in the "Equivalent Price" display on trade results
- Better page/tab titles for trade searchs! If you have the current trade bookmarked, it will use the bookmark's name - otherwise, it will try to infer one based on your search filters
- Live search page/tab titles are now prefixed with a ⚡ icon

## Improvements 💅

- Added a Credits section to the About page. Thanks **InfaMc** for all his work creating the extension!

## Bug fixes 🐛

- Pinning trade results is fixed! You can now find the "Pin" button next to the "Direct Whisper" and "Ignore" buttons again
- Fixed exporting/saving folders and trades whose names contain emoji ([#88](https://github.com/exile-center/better-trading/issues/88)). Thanks @kamilrogo for reporting the issue!
