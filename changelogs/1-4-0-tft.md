# The Forbidden Trove release 🔥

## New features ✨

- Scam prevention against people blacklisted by TFT's community
    - Scammers names will be colored red
    - Clicking on "Whisper" will trigger a warning popup
    - The message still gets copied to the clipboard, to be as unintrusive as possible
- Added a "Report to TFT" button in order to easily report a swap-scammer to TFT's moderation team

BetterTrading Discord server was inactive and only used for announcements purposes. That's why it will be replaced by [TFT's Discord server](https://discord.gg/tftrove). There's a #tool-dev-updates channel where you will be able to get announcements for all your favorite PoE tools.

And finally, if you ever want to [buy me a beer](http://donate.exile.center/) 🍺.
